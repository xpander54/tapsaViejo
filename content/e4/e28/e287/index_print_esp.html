The medium twin, multi-mission helicopter EC155 B1 is aimed at all passenger transport markets requiring comfort and speed and can be tailored to the VIP, corporate, offshore, police, public service and emergency medical service applications.<br />
<br />
Indeed the EC155 B1 offers a significantly larger cabin than previously available in helicopters of its class, cabin that is not encumbered by any aircraft system. A new technology five-composite blade main rotor and an even quieter, efficient, advanced FENESTRON for yaw control have been designed into the EC155 B1with an emphasis placed on high speed and passenger comfort in terms of available space, low vibration<br />
level and low noise.<br />
<br />
Inside the EC155 B1 you will find a spacious cabin which can accommodate in the Passenger Transport configuration 12 passengers with one or two pilots, and in the VIP version, as many as eight executives in a comfortable working environment, designed to reflect the helicopter owner’s unique sense of style and taste. In addition, the EC155 B1 has more than ample baggage space accessible from both sides of the aircraft for<br />
luggage and, if required, additional equipment.<br />
<br />
In the cockpit, the crew manages a carefully designed state-of-the-art glass cockpit. The standard four-axis auto-pilot and ergonomically placed flight displays make the EC155 B1 flying similar to fixed wing jet standards.<br />
<br />
The EC155 B1 is adapted to the most crowded airports where its high-speed permits easy integration with fixed wing traffic during approaches. The high-set main rotor disk and shrouded tail rotor FENESTRON provide unparallel ground crew safety. The wheeled retractable undercarriage ensures freedom to taxi on the most congested ramps without lifting off. In its corporate or VIP livery, the EC155 B1 brings new meaning to flying for business, EUROCOPTER knows only too well that the majority of the cost of ownership is incurred over the operational life of the helicopter. Indeed, as much as 60 % of the life cycle costs occur during the in-service phase. For this reason, reliability, maintainability and supportability are the cornerstones of the design of all EUROCOPTER products.<br />
<br />
The basic EC155 B1 vehicle design is based on the concept of Reliability Centered Maintenance and, as such, embodies a modern concept of dynamic assemblies and systems, use of state of the art materials and technologies, redundant systems and unlimited service life of main components. The EC155 B1 possesses “designed-in maintainability” with numerous interchangeable parts that can be replaced quickly to ease maintenance and reduce down time. The main components (engines, main rotor head, main gearbox) have a modular design and are directly accessible, with minimum requirements to remove other components of the aircraft.<br />
<br />
Created at the end of the 90’s, and with more than 100 helicopters in service worldwide, the mature EC155 B1 has now set new unequalled references in passenger comfort, cruise speed, cockpit ergonomics, easy maintenance with proven track records for safety and reliability for the satisfaction of the most demanding customers.<br />
