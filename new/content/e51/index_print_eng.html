<p class="faqQuestion">Why should I fly in a private jet instead of taking a commercial flight?</p>
 
 
<p class="faqAnswer">
  A private flight brings you a lot of advantages that you simply just can’t have with commercial flights.
<br>
<br>
• You can choose the exact hour of your departure to best fit your schedule. You don’t have to arrive at the airport 2-hours ahead of departure.
<br><br>
• Only you and your colleagues share the flight. You won’t have to deal with the aggravation of strange passengers.
<br><br>
• With a private jet you also have access to smaller regional airports where large commercial planes can’t land. This puts you closer to your destination and saves you even more time.
<br><br>
• The exclusive level of service you receive from our team and at our facilities is much higher and costs less than you would pay at a commercial provider.

<p class="faqQuestion">Are private flights much more expensive than commercial flights?</p>
 
 
<p class="faqAnswer">
  On the contrary! Our business jet seats up to 8 passengers, and the cost is much less when you compare it with buying 8 tickets for Business or First Class on a commercial carrier. Just ask for a quote!
